// My approach to solve the task

/**
You will need to create a JavaScript function, that will provide recommendations on which car a family should select when they make a reservation in a car rental service based on two variables provided:
Family size and planned distance to drive. 

Requirements:

Create two initial variables with the names "familySize" and "plannedDistanceToDrive". Assign initial values to those variables, for example, 2 for "familySize" and 100 for "plannedDistanceToDrive" 
Create a new function with the name "recommendedCar" and pass created variables as arguments of the function.
Write a logic of the function based on these conditions:

if familySize is four or less and the planned distance to drive is less than 200 miles, the function should return "Tesla"

if familySize is four or less and the planned distance to drive is 200 or more, the function should return "Toyota Camry"

if familySize is more than four, the function should return "Minivan"
*/

let familySize = 2;
var plannedDistanceToDrive = 100;

function recommendedCar(familySize, plannedDistanceToDrive) {
    
    const cars = ["Tesla", "Toyota Camry", "Minivan"];
    
    if (familySize <= 4 && plannedDistanceToDrive < 200) {
    return (cars[0]);
    
    } else if (familySize <= 4 && plannedDistanceToDrive >= 200){
    return (cars[1]);

    } else {
    return (cars[2]);
    
    }    
}

console.log(recommendedCar(familySize, plannedDistanceToDrive));
